Yii Notes:

Yii is a PHP framework, developed to be flexible and to work right out of the box.

It can be installed into a directory using composer, and it is possible to, once you've installed all of the dependencies (took me a while), you can have a demo project up and running in minutes.

mkdir demo
cd demo

composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
php yii serve --port=8888

http://localhost:8888/


Configuring Web Servers, something I'm not going to get into right now, can run out of the box with Apache and Nginx HTTP Servers as well as Facebook's HHVM.

To the application:
Yii Implements the MVC architectual pattern, something we should all be familiar with by now. 


ACTIONS AND VIEWS

Creating an Action:
Yii: "Actions are the objects that end users can directly refer to for execution. Actions are grouped by controllers. The execution result of an action is the response that an end user will receive."

Following the Yii docs, I created an action called actionSay in the 
controllers/SiteController.php file. 
This action takes in an argument from the URL and displays it on the webpage
The render method here is going to render a view file named say in the Site directory. 
The method render looks for a PHP file named as views/ControllerID/ViewName.php.


I can try this action out by typing 
http:/localhost:8888/index.php?r=site%2Fsay&message=Hello+World


DATABASE CONNECTION

Connecting to a database
Show database in mysql;

setup params in config/db.php

create an active record-derived class country class in models/Country.php

create a view in view/country/index.php

show in http://localhost:8888/index.php?r=country%2Findex

Page showing five countries- pagination and the linkpager widgets. linkpager renders the page buttons using the urls created by pagination.

Pretty simple framework so far, but the coolest part of Yii, at least in my opinion, is this thing called Gii.

GII

Gii is a module used to automatically generate code. Code is entered using the instructions on the Gii web pages.

Gii needs to be enabled in the modules property of the application (config/web.php)
(check near the bottom if the modules gii is there referencing the yii/gii/Module class)

show country model in models/Country.php
create model Country and generate (preview doesn't work)
show new country model in models/Country.php

generate CRUD
For the "country" example, fill out the resulting form as follows:

    Model Class: app\models\Country
    Search Model Class: app\models\CountrySearch
    Controller Class: app\controllers\CountryController

http://localhost:8888/index.php?r=country%2Findex
